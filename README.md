# Hit seven
Hit seven is a digital adaptation of the board game Flip 7.

## Game Instructions

### Game Objective
The goal is to be the first player to reach **200 points**. Players earn points based on the total value of the cards in their hand at the end of each round.

### How to Play
- **Hit** â€“ Draw a new card to increase your score. However, **if you receive a card that matches one you already have, you bust** and score **0 points** for the round.
- **Skip** â€“ End your turn and **score points equal to the sum of your cards**.

### Scoring and Winning
- At the end of a round, each player who hasnâ€™t busted adds their handâ€™s total value to their overall score.
- The game continues until one or more players reach **200 points**.
- If multiple players exceed 200 points in the same round, the player with the **highest total score** wins.

### Deck Composition
The deck contains **one 0 card** and decreasing numbers of each value from **12 to 1**:

- **Twelve (12)** cards of value 12
- **Eleven (11)** cards of value 11
- **Ten (10)** cards of value 10
- ...
- **One (1)** card of value 1
- **One (0)** card of value 0

**Higher-value cards are more common, but they also increase your chances of busting!**

**Good luck!** ðŸŽ´
